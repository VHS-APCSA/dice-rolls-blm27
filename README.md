# Dice-Rolls
The goal of this project is to tally the outcome of rolling two fair six-sided dice and print a histogram of the result.
Rolling two dice will give you a result between 2 and 12. There is only one way to roll a 2 or a 12 (snake eyes or two sixes)
but there are two ways to roll a 3, 3 ways to roll a 4, etc.

Follow the directions in each of the classes to finish the project.
